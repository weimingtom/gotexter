This AS3 library leverages an open source ActionScript 3.0 Tweening engine (TweenMax / TweenLite) to conveniently build and transition text with embedded fonts.

This library was originally written by Timothy Jordan while at [Daemon Creative](http://www.daemoncreative.com), the interactive group at [Dmax Imaging](http://www.dmaximaging.com).
